# CSV-Data-Visualizer
The application allows users to upload a CSV file, and then generates bar charts, line charts, or pie 
charts based on the user's selection of columns. The code uses Pandas for data manipulation, 
Matplotlib for plotting, and Streamlit for creating the interactive web interface. The application 
handles file uploads, data reading, column type detection, and plot generation, providing a user
friendly way to explore data.
